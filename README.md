# Delays
## Vision
* [Mockup](https://pr.to/X7CRE2/) 
* Crowdsourced tool to know how much the bus is late
	* Chance to read how much is bus late for each urban line
	* Chance to give feedback about how much a bus is late
* The users of this app will be mostly students and why not also other common bus users
* Content for final demo defined: built on the crowdsourcing principle, this app gives the user the chance to check for bus delays and to report them. 

> Every morning a student wakes up and knows he has to run faster than the bus. So we thought: _“why not to create an app that tells you that your bus is late and you can sleep another 5 minutes?”_. This app allows users from all over Trento to report other lazy people about buses’ conditions. It’s a crowdsource-based app so we trust you: don’t think only for yourselves, think for everybody, and the prices.
